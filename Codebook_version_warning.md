Note: the plots prepared in this repo (see "README.md") were generated using R Version 3.3.3.
A subsetted version of the UCI file called "household_power_consumption.txt" was utilized in order to spare
computer memory; this version solely contained the information for the dates required in the instructions.
R Version 3.4.1,released June 30, 2017, instituted some changes, such as deprecating the separate "graphics" downloadable
package.  These files should run on both versions of R, but may produce some warnings if 3.4.1 is used.

Additionally, some overlap, particularly in data processing,
between each .R file was unavoidable in order to generate separate .R files.

RStudio (using R 3.4.1) was used to generate the plots, from 2017-07-06 to 2017-07-08.
