Note: the plots prepared in this repo (see "README.md") were generated using R Version 3.3.3.  R Version 3.4.1,
released June 30, 2017, instituted some changes, such as deprecating the separate "graphics" downloadable
package.  These files should run on both versions of R, but may produce some warnings if 3.4.1 is used.

Additionally, some overlap, particularly in data processing,
between each .R file was unavoidable in order to generate separate .R files.
